                <p>
                    By enrolling in an Online Course or purchasing any of our Services and providing Udacity with your payment information, you hereby agree to these payment terms. To purchase any services or products offered by Udacity through
                    the Services, you must have Internet access and a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up process ("Payment Method"). You agree to Udacity, or its third-party payment provider, storing and accessing
                    your payment information. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the services or products you purchase through the Udacity Services as they become due, whether on a one-time, installment, or subscription basis. Fees
                    may vary based on your location, the type of Payment Method used, where your Payment Method was issued, or other contractual arrangements. Your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in
                    prices, including because of exchange rates. Udacity does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment and may vary such offerings from time to time. Additionally, you understand and agree that not
                    all promotions and pricing are available to all Students, and that specific additional terms and conditions (such as the Special Nanodegree Terms) may apply to certain promotional programs, pricing, or geographic locations.
                    You agree to use your own valid Payment Method and not impersonate or otherwise use a Payment Method to avoid regulatory restrictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automatic Subscription Based Payments. BY SELECTING AN AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION BASED ENROLLMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE UDACITY TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE THE APPLICABLE RECURRING MONTHLY FEE AND ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE TAXES TO
                    YOUR PAYMENT METHOD UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL, ARE REMOVED, OR GRADUATE. For any Services or products that are provided on an automatic subscription basis, unless otherwise specified during enrollment, your first monthly
                    payment will be charged to your Payment Method upon your purchase date. Upon completion of your purchase, your access to the Online Course begins, and so does the two (2) day refund period. For some Online Courses, you may
                    be provided access for a limited Online Course preview period (“Course Preview”) and your first payment will be scheduled for the date of the end of the Course Preview. At the time of the first scheduled payment your Payment
                    Method will be charged and your automatic-renewal subscription will start; as does the two (2) day refund period at that time. You may not receive a notice from us that your two (2) day refund period has ended or that the
                    subscription-based payments have begun. Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis with recurring payments unless and until you cancel, are removed, or graduate. You agree to pay the then-current applicable
                    monthly payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the first month automated subscription payment, for each subsequent month, the monthly fee will automatically be billed on the monthly anniversary date of your initial credit card charge date (“Billing Date”). For
                    example, if you begin a paid subscription on January 5th, you will be charged on subsequent monthly anniversary of your purchase date; therefore you would be billed January 5th for the first month and your Billing Date will
                    be the 5th of each subsequent month until you cancel or are removed from the Online Course or graduate. For certain months, your Billing Date may vary slightly if your Billing Date does not have a corresponding date the
                    following month – for example if the first charge was made on January 31st you will be billed on February 28th, and then on March 31st the following month. Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pre-Orders for Online Courses.</strong> If you elect to pre-order and secure a subscription in an Online Course, you will be required to provide your accurate Payment Method, however your Payment Method will not be
                    charged at the time of the pre-order. Your Payment Method will only be charged when the Online Course officially starts and you receive access to the Online Course content and associated services. Thereafter your Payment
                    Method will be charged in accordance with the terms that you selected at the time of your pre-order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bundled Subscription Payments.</strong> If you elect to purchase access to an Online Course in the form of a bundled offering, you purchase a fixed, multi-month subscription access to the Online Course at a
                    discounted rate, and following the fixed, multi-month term, you will revert to a monthly automatic subscription payment method. Accordingly, there will be a one-time fee paid upfront for the fixed, multi-month term access to
                    the Online Course, and following the end of the fixed, multi-month term, you will revert to a monthly automatic renewal subscription payment method. Accordingly, each month following the fixed, multi-month term, a monthly,
                    non-discounted fee will automatically be billed at the rate indicated on your initial payment check-out page, the monthly anniversary date of your initial credit card charge date (“Billing Date”). For more details see the
                    ‘Automated Subscription Based Payment’ Section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Online Courses purchased with a Bundled offering payment, upon completion of your purchase your access to your Online Course will begin, so does your two (2) day refund period. For some Online Courses, following your
                    enrolment, you may be provided access to a Course Preview and your first payment will be scheduled for the date of the end of the Course Preview. Following the Course Preview, at the time of the first scheduled payment your
                    Payment Method, will be charged and your automatic-renewal subscription will start; as does the two (2) day refund period at that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Manual Subscription Payments.</strong> If you elect to pay by manual monthly subscription payment for an Online Course, you will be required to make a payment each month in order to manually renew your subscription
                    and to maintain your access to the Online Course. Your two (2) day refund period will start upon your payment and access to the Online Course. In the event that you fail to manually renew your monthly subscription payment,
                    your access to the Online Course will end at the end of the monthly period for which you have paid. If you terminate your manual subscription and re-enroll for the same Online Course, you will gain access to the Online
                    Course and be provided a two (2) day refund period, provided however, Students are only entitled to one refund per Online Course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Term-Based Payments.</strong> For Online Courses that are provided on a fixed-term basis there will be a one-time fee set forth on the applicable Online Course information and enrollment page. Payments will be in a
                    one-time, flat-fee which is paid upfront. Your 7-day refund period will comment upon your date of purchase for the Online Course.

                <p><strong>Legal Disputes and Arbitration Agreement</strong> <strong>Please Read This Following Clause Carefully – It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Initial Dispute Resolution.</strong> We are available by email at <a href=" #">support@udacity.com</a> to address any concerns you may have regarding these Terms or your use of the Services.
                    Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. Each of you and we agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall
                    be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Agreement to Binding Arbitration.</strong> If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the Section above, then
                    either party may initiate binding arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the
                    Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class
                    actions. Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules
                    and Procedures. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
                    formation of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings
                    not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in San Francisco County, California, U.S.A., at your option. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever
                    relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as
                    a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of the Terms of Use shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href=" #"> #</a> or by calling 1-800-352-5267. If you initiate arbitration,
                    to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250), we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a
                    request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS. We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration
                    costs arising in connection with the arbitration, other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting fees or amounts payable to JAMS. You will not be
                    required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration. We will also pay JAMS to reimburse you for any portion of the $250 filing fee that is more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file
                    suit in a court of law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in
                    court.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.</strong> You and Udacity each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other
                    representative action, and you and Udacity each expressly waive our respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in
                    this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in this Section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the
                    parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Exception - Small Claims Court Claims.</strong> Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within
                    the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Exception – California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) Action.</strong> Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a court of law for a
                    claim arising under California’s Private Attorneys General Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>30 Day Right to Opt-Out.</strong> You can opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending a written request to <a href=" #">opt-out@udacity.com</a> within thirty (30) days of first accepting
                    these Terms of Use, or within thirty (30) days of any subsequent modification to the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section. Your request to opt-out of arbitration must include your (i) name, (ii) mailing address,
                    (iii) email address, and (iv) express request to opt-out from the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section. If you opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms
                    and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use shall continue to apply to your use of the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Exclusive Venue for Litigation.</strong> To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section do not apply, or if you have opted out of arbitration, the parties agree that any litigation between them
                    shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). The parties expressly consent to
                    exclusive jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California for any litigation other than small claims court actions. In the event of litigation relating to these Terms, the parties agree to waive, to the maximum extent
                    permitted by law, any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.
